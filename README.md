- ### Machine Learning
    -  [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/tssdantas/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Mushroom_classification) An algorithm in Python 3.8.5 is presented to solve the classification problem of mushroom data into the classes of "edible" or "poisonous". The mushroom data is was obtained from kaggle.com and it contains 22 features/ independent variables. The classification methods used are: Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors Voting, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks and Grandient Boosting Classifier. The Python packages used are: Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn.
    -  [Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition](https://github.com/tssdantas/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/SkinCancer) This algorithm uses Keras with Tensorflow backend to train and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the image classification problem of skin cancer detection. The target classes are 'benign' and 'malignant' represented in 1800 and 1500 image samples, respectively. The data set should be downloaded from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign).
